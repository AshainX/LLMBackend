# LLM Implementation

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Language Learning Model (LLM) using PyTorch. The implementation includes a transformer-based architecture with multi-head attention mechanisms.

## Features

- Transformer-based architecture
- Multi-head self-attention
- Position embeddings
- Training and validation loops
- Gradient clipping and optimization

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd simple-llm
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Model Architecture:
   - The model is defined in `model.py`
   - Key components: MultiHeadAttention, TransformerBlock, and SimpleLLM classes

2. Training:
   - Training logic is implemented in `train.py`
   - Includes training and validation loops
   - Supports GPU acceleration

## Training Your Own Model

```python
from model import SimpleLLM
from train import Trainer

# Initialize model
model = SimpleLLM(
    vocab_size=50000,  # Adjust based on your tokenizer
    d_model=512,       # Embedding dimension
    num_heads=8,       # Number of attention heads
    num_layers=6       # Number of transformer layers
)

# Initialize trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    train_loader=your_train_dataloader,
    val_loader=your_val_dataloader,
    learning_rate=3e-4
)

# Start training
trainer.train(num_epochs=10)
```

## Notes

- This is a basic implementation meant for educational purposes
- For production use, consider using established frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers
- Training LLMs requires significant computational resources
- Consider using gradient accumulation for larger models
- Experiment with hyperparameters for better results
